# **PickPlanner**

Welcome to **PickPlanner**! An app I am currently developing to help warehouse managers deploy operatives to specific areas in the warehouse more intentionally, increasing their chances of reaching their targets for the shift. PickPlanner allows managers to use data such as performance rates and number of pickers to make more informed decisions allowing for time optimisation.
