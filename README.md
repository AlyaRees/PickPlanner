# **PickPlanner**  

Welcome to **PickPlanner**!  
An app I am currently developing to help warehouse managers deploy operatives to specific areas in the warehouse more intentionally, increasing their chances of reaching their targets for the shift. PickPlanner allows managers to use data such as performance rates and the number of pickers to make more informed decisions, allowing for time optimization.

## ðŸŽ¯ **How to Use**  

### General Workflow  
- PickPlanner takes data input and extracts relevant data.  
- It processes this data and runs a calculation to produce the **estimated finish time**, indicating when all cases of stock will be picked by warehouse operatives.  
- The required time to pick is based on an 8-hour shift (2 PMâ€“10 PM). The number of hours remaining to pick is calculated as the difference between the data input time and the shift end time (10 PM). This factors into how the estimated finish time is calculated.

### **Try it out yourself! (No Downloads Needed)**  

1. Open **PickPlanner** on your desktop/laptop or mobile phone: [https://alyarees.github.io/PickPlanner/](https://alyarees.github.io/PickPlanner/).  
2. (On mobile phone) Click **Chill** and then **'Add'**. Or for desktop/laptop select **'Add'** in the chill card.
3. Input the following example data (feel free to input numbers of your own choice):  
   - **Pick target:** `43000`  
   - **Amount picked:** `2000`  
   - **Number of employees:** `19`  
   - **Cases per hour:** `253.08`  

6. Click **'Submit'**.  
7. You will now be redirected to the display page with the **estimated finish time** along with other relevant data!  
8. *(Note: In a real-life scenario, if the number of employees or other data were to change, you can retype and submit the updated numbers. The calculation will update accordingly without needing to clear and re-add all the data.)*
